Title: Personal Goals for 2019
Date: 2019-01-12

It's been [quite a long time][1] since I've publicly posted goals. One year into my next
job, it's time self-motivate long term self-improvement goals by discussing them in
public.

1. Make Anki a daily habit
2. Start and complete a useful machine learning project
3. Master puppet
4. Start attending tech meetups in the bay area.
5. Consolidate retirement accounts

I want to adopt Anki as part of a lifetime learning framework. It's more
commonly used for learning languages, and cramming for med school, but it should be
good for other purposes. No more forgetting birthdays, or obscure core library
functions! I've got a decent start at it, but due to unfortunate computer repair
circumstances, I missed a few months. No more!

Given my current role, it makes sense to learn more about ML. There have been amazing
advances since I took a course in undergrad, from results, to techniques, and even just
ease of use libraries. Making a useful project should hopefully ease completing this
goal.

Similarly, Puppet is something I need to get better at. I spent a long time using Chef,
and not everything maps cleanly. I need to catch up since the puppet2 days, and start
aborbing modern Puppet practices. Also useful, attending more tech meetups in the area.
SVLUG hasn't really met since I started thinking about attending, but this may be an
example of victim of success -- people have moved on from 'using linux' to more niche
tools that assume Linux as a baseline.

Finally, job hopping has left me with a series of retirement accounts that is getting
tedious to track individually. It's probably pretty easy to call up and get this
sorted, so this is a reminder to pull off the social anxiety band-aid.
