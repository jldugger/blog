Title: The beginning of the end
Date: 2004-01-20


The end is neigh! The beginning of the end is near - the Spring semester begins on Thursday. I'm taking a fairly 
light course load, but there's the classes I'm taking should be fairly intensive. (Note to self, update schedule) 
Graphics is gonna be cool; Cantrell has still been working on his spline based GLscreensaver. Now the splines are 
all glowy and wide.

Seems like I only update this page when I'm nearing the end of a cycle of debugging my desktop. This time around 
I've gotten SMB working, dug into the internals of iptables (the internet firewall / fitler for linux) and 
upgraded to a 2.6 kernel. A lot of people have said the preemptive stuff in 2.6 really helped desktop performance, 
but I haven't noticed any of that. I'll look at it more after I stop using Debian's provided kernel. I also moved 
the video drivers up to the latest version (and started using Debian's provided package). Looks like the internet 
ruminations were right on this one -- I get lower performance, hiccups and an annoying static on sound when 
programs do something somewhat video intensive, like openGL or full screen scrolling. Time to look into pinning 
the old drivers back. Also pointed out a minor bug in the Debian packages to the maintainer, he forgot to move a 
base package up to the new version when he moved the rest forward.

One and a half tons of stationary power
=======================================
My brother, Cole, has been borrowing my car a lot lately, since his RX-7 has forgotten how to stop. This is a 
practice he'll be weened from when I leave tomorrow for school. He's looking to replace the brake booster now. The 
garage thought it was the master cylinder, but when he took it home to repair it, replacing it fixed nothing. Now 
he's repairing the power booster. Not that my car isn't a piece of crap. I'm still on my first car, some 6 years 
later. My roommate, Zack's been through several more than I, and my brother's already gone through one in his first
year driving. He likes sporty cars -- his first was a CRX, a compact he made even more so after running into a SUV 
stopped in the middle of the road. Now he has an RX-7. The rotory idea is pretty cool, and I hear they're 
considering bringing it back if the RX-8 does ok in the market. So far its still on factory order. Myself, I'm 
more interested in some other engineering marvels. Hybrid electric cars are pretty nifty. Solid milage and they 
still move faster than my current car. Regenerative braking is cool, and theres all sorts of nifty things you can 
do with two different engines. The electric engine in the Prius functions as part of a continuously variable 
transmission, replaces the starter, is used to charge the batteries, and pitches in during high performance 
situations. 

Dad really likes the hydrogen idea, but really hydrogen is just a liquid battery. Its nice in a 
modular energy design, but you still need a power source somewhere to create the fuel. And the distribution of 
hydrogen power is sort of a chicken and egg situation. If nobody buys a hydrogen powered car, there's no reason 
for stations to sell hydrogen. But very few would buy a hydrogen based car without a hydrogen source nearby. In 
theory, you could have a hydrogen generator plugged in your garage, but expect crazy energy bills, especially in 
the summer where the extra heat will seap into your air conditioned house. Hybrid electrics on the other hand, 
offer energy savings and build on an existing infrastructure. Yay hybrid!

Games
=====

Picked up F Zero GX, a futuristic racer for the Gamecube. Very beautiful game, for the brief period in the learning
curve where one looks for these things. I hope I can find an arcade cabinet with it soon, its very fun, and I'd 
love to see the arcade tracks. Someone has just released an initial beta of a gamecube Linux. Interesting stuff 
that I'd look into further if I had the tools. I'd need a special screwdriver to open the case, the rare ethernet 
adaptor to boot, and an image server. Lets just say Nintendo has their bases covered in preventing piracy. 
Unfortunately, this also makes it harder to run anything else on the Cube. This is part for the course in console 
systems however. You pay big bucks for the privledge of having hardware that is more functional (I hear the 
developer systems can read CD-Rs).

I also ordered Ikaruga from Best Buy for 20 dollars. Its gone from back ordered in 5 to 9 days to 30 days to 90!. 
If they don't have it and don't expect it in, they should have listed it that way. Wow this has been a long entry.
