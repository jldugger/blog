Title: Good as new!
Date: 2011-03-10

So much for pristine brand new car condition. Bumped into a car in a parking 
lot last week. The other car barely had any damage, just some paint that will
probably buff right out.

Apparently modern bumpers are made of plastic, and can be repaired with a heat
gun. [Witness][2]:
