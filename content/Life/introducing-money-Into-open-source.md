Title: Introducing Money Into Open Source
Date: 2008-08-04

Jeff Atwood's [Coding Horror][1] is a blog ostensibly about "Programming and
Human Factors". So then Jeff's [proposition][2] about donating money in OSS is
a little troublesome. Jeff is confused and needs help spending money, like [ a
popular novel and film][3]. I've stopped reading Coding Horror on a daily
basis long ago, but the goals behind this particular theme are well placed,
and it seems like a worthwhile initiative. He [writes about donating $5,000 to
an open source .NET project][4]:

> I had hoped that $5,000 grant money would be converted into something that
furthered an open source project -- perhaps something involving the community
and garnering more code contributions. But apparently that's more difficult
than anyone realized.

>[...] I'm absolutely dumbfounded to learn that contributing money isn't
an effective way to advance an open source project. Surely money can't be
totally useless to open source projects... can it?

What follows below is the kind of research Jeff Atwood should have done in
preparation of giving that money. What I think would have been most useful to
Jeff is researching what has already been done, though I suppose he's not got
**time** for such trivial things.

[After the fold: Ubuntu, Inkscape, Google SoC, dunc-tank and nouveau!][5]
