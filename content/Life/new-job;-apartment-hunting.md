Title: New job; apartment hunting
Date: 2010-10-04

Picked up a job with KSU starting next month. More details later. But first, I
need to line up a place to live. I'm pursuing a number of options, but let's
start with the tactic that landed me a sweet place to live last time I moved
out to Manhattan: anyone need a roommate? Or know someone cool who does?
