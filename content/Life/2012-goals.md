Title: 2011 Goal Review and 2012 Goals
Date: 2012-01-02

In January I published five goals:

1. Learn and practice SEO techniques.
2. Explore website revenue and analysis.
3. Reinvigorate K-SLUG student participation.
4. Impress folks by being great at my new job.
5. Write down tasks to improve productivity and quality of life.

Arguably I accomplished 4 of them. Obviously this isn't 5 for 5, and the main 
reason is that I spent more time *really* analyzing my personal finances. I've 
been keeping personal books since 2007, but this year I had some unexpected
family oblications as motivation to really bring it up a notch. I dug into 
the local library collection on personal finance in August, and I've basically 
reached the point where books just repeat themselves. The mundane stuff has
been automated for quite a while, so I can just focus on planning, analyzing 
and tweaking. I've used 2011's last paycheck to work up tax returns and found
a bug in my annual budget spreadsheet's tax calculations. 

To put the knowledge to the test, I started asking and answering questions on 
reddit and StackExchange's money subsite, where I found a couple of neat 
options university employees that I should write a full post on. The bad news 
is there's so many small tricks to consider, it can soak up as much time as you
let it. But I did actually make some changes, so it's not a total analysis 
paralysis. I opened and funded a savings account, and tuned my health insurance
policies during open enrollment. I came up with a conservative estimate for 
FSA allocation to save on taxes. I moved away from the semi-luxury apartments 
for a cheaper yet comparable place, with garage parking to boot. I researched 
how to sell used video games and moved half of my video game collection. 

Goals for 2012
==============

1. Be awesome at my new role.
2. Finish catching up on my backlog of games and podcasts.
3. Book diet; no more than 12 books this year.
4. Establish a retirement savings goal and act on it.
5. Twelve informative blog posts; no mindless link propagation or blogging
   about blogging!

Some of this is lessons from last year; I started coming back from the library
with more books than I really have time to read, so #3 is an attempt to rate
limit myself, because I found out that Microsoft Research has like two 
thousand video lectures online, so I'll never actually catch up to *that*, but
I can catch up on the podcasts from the past few months. And finish selling off
video games to roll them back into the budget.

Goal #4 is really about finding a balance between saving and spending. I think I 
have the unusual problem of saving too much. While it's been crucial for
helping out sick parents, my basic retirement strategy is "don't buy anything
and save everything you can," because I haven't really figured out how much I
can spend and still retire comfortably.

And #5 is about commiting to putting the polishing touches on a few posts that
have been brewing. And cutting back on blogging about goals--this shall be the
last until 2013!
