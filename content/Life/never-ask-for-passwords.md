Title: Never Ask For Passwords
Date: 2011-10-25

Once again, it's demonstrated that sitting around a table drafting
policy fails the common sense test. [Chronicle of Higher Education][1]
reports that Sam Houson State University decided to ask all members for
username and passwords. Their [published policy][2] still does. My
favorite part:

> Do not change any passwords issued with the accounts. If there is a problem
> or compromise of the accounts security, contact the Marketing and Communications
> Social Media Representatives. They will issue you a new password. *Do not share
> login and password information with unauthorized individuals*.

Most social media sites support OAuth, which allows apps to read and write 
to your feed without sharing an underlying username/password. Moreover, if all 
you're doing is mere aggregation, there's no need to ask for this information.
You automate censors, you implement a blacklist, and you move on. There's no need
to edit posts directly, there's no need to spam thunderstorm warnings on every twitter
feed you can find.
