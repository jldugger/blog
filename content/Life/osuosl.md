Title: In like a lion, out like a Wildcat!
Date: 2012-03-30

March has been a month of great change for K-State. Frank Martin left for the east
coast, in a departure you might have heard about at the water cooler. What you probably
didn't hear, is that I left in the opposite direction for a new position with the Open
Source Lab. Today ends my first week with the Lab, and it's quite a rush. 

Working with K-State was interesting and intellectually stimulating in many ways, and I
wish the Wildcats I've left behind in Manhattan all the luck in their endevors. K-State
has given me a lot of knowledge and experience and it's time to share it with the
outside world.

The role I'm taking on with the [OSU Open Source Lab][1] is a System Administrator role,
managing systems and student workers. This is a unique and wonderful opportunity to 
contribute back to the open source community that's benefited me personally and 
professionally. The OSL provides managed and unmanaged systems to a number of projects,
and trains student workers as sysops. Not about to propose any major changes, but
there's always room for improvement, and I've got a few ideas that need to bake for a 
while longer yet.

But for now, I think it's time to enjoy the weekend.
