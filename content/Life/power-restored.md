Title: Power restored
Date: 2007-12-18

Nearly six days and two very cold nights after the ice storm demolished
Manhattan's power infrastructure, we finally regained electricity to the
house.Â  I suppose I'll remember this as a lost week -- I was unable to really
accomplish anything but eat sleep and complain.
