Title: Adios, Gamerfeed
Date: 2010-08-16

I've been seeking out feeds to sync to my front page, in order to keep the
front page interesting, updated, and sync'd. One such interesting feed I tried
was my Xbox 360 gamertag. The idea was to update every time I had a new game.
Instead, it's been spamming every day I play, which is pretty damn annoying.
I've left it on, with the theory that I'd locate a better feed or fix it
somehow. Well, I'm declaring todo list bankruptcy on that one. Fixing it may
take quite a while, and the value is just too low to bother with.

Maybe once I finish my home inventory and valuation project I'll tweak it
to list new game purchases in XML. Until then, you'll just have to ask or
check [Microsoft's web site][1].
