Title: Incentives
Date: 2009-05-15

I had drafted an article on UbuntuOne, but clearly this has been beaten to
death. But has anyone else noticed how regressive Amazon S3 is? That's gotta
have some unsavory market implications, and likely means an open source
service available on S3 will be at a competitive disadvantage to a centralized
operator.
