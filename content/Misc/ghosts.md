Title: Ghosts
Date: 2008-03-04

So I grabbed the latest NiN experiment. Reports from frustrated users unable
to download their purchase suggest it works well enough to be popular, though
my experience with the torrent suggests piracy is still the distribution
method to beat ;)

As far as the music itself, I'm unimpressed mostly. The album presents
itself as an "instrumental," but unless Trent Reznor's dictionary defines it
as "unmelodic ambient music", I think that word misses the mark. Only a few
tracks stand out musically to me. Clearly this album wouldn't succeed in music
stores. It appears the purpose here is to exploit collectors or perhaps
promote something akin to selling Garageband files whenever that gets
announced. I've never understood the appeal of that stuff -- all you can
really do is sample the tracks. You won't be able to add in an awesome solo
from the bass noise machine or anything and expect it to fit in.

Although, for some reason 28 Ghosts IV reminds me of an acoustic version
of Dethklok's Go into the Sea for some reason. But we all know that acoustic
is lame and totally not metal.
