Title: A Guerilla Slashdot User's Guide
Date: 2007-12-22

[Slashdot,][1] rightly or wrongly, has a bad reputation.  They post duplicates
(guilty) and the comments are all idiots.  I find slashdot comments, treated
properly, give an extra dimension to the article in question.  Allow me to
give you some tips on finding Slashdot more productive, useful, or at least
entertaining.

[Use AdBlock Plus][2]. This works for lots of sites, and Slashdot is no
exception.  It cuts loading times, and animated annoyances.

Second, create an account.  If you're worried about spam, you can try
services like [Mailinator][3] but it seems like they're onto this stuff and
don't like it. They block Mailinator addresses as "invalid".  And claimed I
some how cut and double pasted one email address to where they don't match.
So maybe that's a downside.  It does suggest they intend to sell your email
address, or else they wouldn't care how easy it is to set up throwaway email
addys.

Once you've established an account, you can now set personal preferences
for the site.  Moderation is the system that makes large boards feasible.
Slashdot has crowdsourced moderation, long before that word even existed.
Crowd moderation is better than no moderation, but it isn't all roses.  You'll
need some jujitsu to make this thing work.

 * First ensure you're using threaded mode, with the old comment style.
There's always some beta comment system, as equally confusing as omnipresent.
Preferences -> Comments -> Discussion Style: Classic mode.  Below that
is Display mode, and you want Threaded.

* Then sort by Highest Ratings (but not the ignore threads option).  Then set
the Threshold to 1 or 2.  Conversations are hard to read when half the thread
is sliced out by moderation. Below that, set the Highlight Threshold to 2.
This way anything moderated will be readable or gone.

* Thirdly, muck with the Reason Modifier.  This one deserves a bit more
explanation.

One of the thorns in the rosebush of Slashdot moderation is the tyranny of the
majority opinion.  Pointing out flaws in Linux, or otherwise deviating from
the world view of Slashdottery can result in instant flamebait moderation.
Flamebait is an interesting moderation -- it's essentially saying the post is
contraversial, but not offensive or spam. In my book, that's _interesting_; in
slashdot's book the moderation is treated as a _negative._  The comment is
bumped down one point.   My best trick is this: **To best read Slashdot
comment threads, change flamebait from 0 to +4.  **Suddenly, the other halves
of debates become visible.  Or at least far more hilarious.

Of course, this requires that moderators not change their views
significantly.  If flamebait begins to be interpreted as Ron Paul spam, or
some other concept, the whole thing breaks down. So if you moderate slashdot,
ignore this whole post.
