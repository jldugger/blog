Title: Addendum
Date: 2008-01-17

After finding a better document on p7zip (/usr/share/doc/p7zip/examples), I've
found the command options

> 7za a -t7z -mx=9 -ms=on -mmt=on

do a much better job of compressing, bringing the total in line with the
aforementioned torrent. From 2 DVDs to a quarter, is good stuff I think. There
is a downside, though: ZSNES and snes9x don't support this archive format
natively. But they didnt support the grouping format with zip either. So no
huge loss I guess.
