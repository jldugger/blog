Title: About time
Date: 2009-05-12

[FTC][1] is gearing up to do something about Car Warranty robocalling scams.

Clearly these people are one step ahead technologically at the moment, to be
able to wardial like that without being caught or even blocked. Maybe someone
will write a phone app where you can just report these numbers to the relevant
authorities on with a single button press. That's the sort of phone software
that might actually cause me to purchase a smartphone over my current $100
annual phone plan.
