Title: Podcasts 2016
Date: 2016-12-25

Every so often, I see a podcast recommendation thread on [HN][65] / Reddit / elsewhere. Rather than repeat 
myself, here's an annotated list of podcasts I listen to. If you're needin a great podcast Android player, I recommend
[AntennaPod][1], which has a thriving [open source][2] community behind it. On to the list!

Coda: What makes a great podcast?
---------------------------------

Perhaps this is influenced by my short commute time, but I prefer single topic podcasts of 20 minutes or less. Long 
enough to cover a subject in greater detail than you get on the 3 minute news segment shows, but not so long as to 
fatigue the listener. We know that [long lectures][67] do poorly on online learning platforms, but the lesson is not to
never cover things in depth, but to break deep topics into smaller segments.

Audio quality is really important; doing a podcast via cell phone as a repeat occurance is a good way to earn my
unsubscription. Editing out most of the [speech disfluencies][66] is a good idea, not only out of respect for the
listener's time, but for the speaker's own self-image. On a similar note, pets / screaming children distract from the
message of professionalism the typical podcast wishes to communicate.
