Title: One of these things is not like the other
Date: 2009-02-03

The local tabloid, _Pitch_, recently ran [a story][1] about competitive gaming
with an emphasis on classic arcade games. One star from a previous era makes a
bizarre nostalgic comment:

> "Back then, it was more of a brotherhood," he says. "Today, there's far more
tension among those people. Also, bad habits have popped up. People are
playing too many games, eating bad foods, not getting out in the sun. People
are up till 4 a.m. playing games without their parents knowing and eating
genetically modified foods."
