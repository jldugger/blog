Title: OpenMoko or Android G1?
Date: 2008-11-08

Having killed my cellphone with a good cycle in the washer, I'm in the new
phone market I guess. Besides simply replacing the model I damaged ("the cheap
option"), I'm also looking at OpenMoko and Android. Trouble is, they're both
the same price, and nobody really has published a direct comparison.

I like the idea of running Linux on a phone, and having a wide degree of
freedom to customize, but with other fun hardware on the way, I'm not sure how
much time I'd really devote to tinkering with a phone I'd rather have working
100 percent of the time. So I'm looking for three kinds of advice:

  * **why I should get an OpenMoko** from people who own one

  * **why I should get an HTC G1** from people who own one

  * **a comparison** from people who own either but have used both

The last category strikes me as rare, but it can't hurt to ask.
