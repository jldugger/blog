Title: More raw events
Date: 2008-05-07

If you're interested in Linux and tired of shitty "top 10 commends" on Digg,
recycled articles and news filters like Slashdot, here's two interesting
things I've found in the past few days:

[FOSDEM 2008 videos][1] -- a developer conference to present new software 
and technologies. That page has the past 4 years worth of videos


[Ubuntu Open Week][2] was last week. There was a bit of last minute schedule 
changes so some of them were short on good questions. Often they seem like 
someone cutting and pasting a wiki page, which is unfortunate. It might be 
time to revisit the idea and tweak some things.
