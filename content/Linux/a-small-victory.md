Title: A small victory
Date: 2008-05-28

During a search for some open source software, I came across a curiously
licensed project. A brief snippet:

> You may copy, distribute and use the Software according to the Gnu Public
License (GPL) as long as you agree to and comply with any and all conditions
in this license.

>Limitations

>1. You may with this license only use the Software for non- commercial
purposes. [...]


A bit saddened by the missing freedom 0, I wrote the author merely asking
for clarification, and in response he's declared intent to relicense under
GPLv3. This is only a small victory, as it doesn't currently build for Linux,
but it has in the past and I think getting it to build again is a proper
reward for this positive step.
