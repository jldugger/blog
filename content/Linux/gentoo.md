Title: Birth of a Linux user
Date: 2003-01-21

Back from break! Tried installing Gentoo after win98 fried itself, now I'm 
playing with Debian. So far its going much smoother, although it feels odd not 
knowing whats going on underneath the hood. I gotta say the gentoo user docs 
are very nice. Time to figure out how to customize and configure X. Maybe 
sometime I'll try out different colorschemes for this website, like 
[kuro5hin][1].
