Title: The Ubuntu Canvas
Date: 2008-07-12

Dear Lazyweb,

Can anyone give me statistics on the following Ubuntu userbase properties:

  * distribution of screen size, resolution, and DPI

  * distribution of virtual and physical color bit depth

  * subpixel rendering usage

A reported statistic from the Hardware Database or popcon or something
automatically reported would be handy, but inferred statistics like Ubuntu.com
or Launchpad visitors and stand-ins like PC users in general are also valuable
for validation. I think it's important to know where current users stand in
relation to users in general.

This information seems valuable for discussing things like legibility of
default fonts in Intrepid and so on. So please share any information!
