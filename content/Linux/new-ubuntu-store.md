Title: New Ubuntu Store
Date: 2008-11-20

Seemingly in response to an [earlier post][1] of mine, Canonical has recently
[launched][2] a US based [store][3]. Since they've gone to the trouble to risk
taking my advice, I suppose it's only fair that I shill a bit for them.

Prices before were close to 40 dollars for a shirt after taxes and shipping.
They're now closer to 25, and I think I'll put in an order at that price.

The store's new, so it's not yet perfected -- they ship a [fun set of
stickers][4] via UPS Ground, a 7 dollar charge for something that could
probably be sent for 42 cents. That's okay, [system76][5] still offers
[stickers][6] for the price of a SASE ([?][7]) as a draw (and sales lead) to
their store.

One product suggestion: [Aluminum case badges.][8]
