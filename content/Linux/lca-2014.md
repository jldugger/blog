Title: LCA 2014 Videos of Note
Date: 2014-01-12

[Linuxconf 2014][1] wrapped up last week, and the [videos are already online][2]!

I didn't get a chance to review all the video, but here's some of the sessions I
thought were interesting:

[Rusty Russel discusses virtIO standardization][3]. I thought I knew what virtIO was but his
initial explaination leaves me more confused than I started out. Nevertheless, Rusty gives a 
implementer's view of the standardization process, and shares how virtIO manages forward and
backward compatibility between hypervisor, guest OSes, and even hardware.

[Elizabeth Krumbach Joseph explains how the OpenStack Core Infra team publishes does their work in the open.][4] We've taken a similar approach, so its nice to see other approaches and bits we
might steal =). Storing Jenkins jobs in YAML in config management sounds very nice, and I will
have to bring it up at my next meeting.

[Bdale Garbee shares his experience losing his home][5] to the [Black Forest Fire][6]. As a serial 
renter / mover, I'm already well prepared to answer the question "What would you take if you had 
five minutes to clean out your home?" So I would have liked a bit more in the way of disaster 
recovery / offsite backups / tech stuff, but but I happen to know he rescued his servers from 
the fire and isn't storing them locally anymore. So perhaps there is no lesson to share yet =)

[Michael Still presents a third party CI approach for database migrations][7] in OpenStack. Looks
like a combo of gerrit for code reviews, Zuul, and [some custom zuul gearman worker][8].
Surprisingly little duplicate content from the other open stack infrastructure talk!

[Jim Cheetham asks 'Is it safe to mosh?'][9] The answer appears to be yes, but takes a hands off
approach to the underlying cryto. 

Lots of exciting talks, and maybe I need to sit down and think about writing my own proposal for
LCA 2015.
