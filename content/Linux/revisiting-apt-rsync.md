Title: Revisiting apt-rsync
Date: 2008-05-26

I found a [fairly thorough review][1] of apt-rsync and where it stands as of
2002. It's six years old but still relevant. An interesting point it makes is
that apt-get update could be handled with rsync cheaply.

For now on, I think I'll refer future advocates to that post and ask them
to come up with hard numbers for costs incurred. It's important to change the
status quo, not for change's sake alone, but for the improvements it brings.
