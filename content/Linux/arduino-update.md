Title: Arduino Update
Date: 2010-07-09

An alert (and anonymous) reader commented on a [previous post][1] about
[Arduino][2] packaging, letting me know that [packaging has been accepted into
Debian][3]â€”both the Java IDE and the underlying compiler toolchain. A big
thanks to Phil Hands and Scott Howard for their efforts!

This is a very new package, so patches are still rolling in. The
DebianImportFreeze has come and gone, but Scott appears to be on top of
things, having just [filed a sync request][4] a few hours ago to pull in a few
more changes. If he keeps that pace up, he'll make MOTU in no time ;)
