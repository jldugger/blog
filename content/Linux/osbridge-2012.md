Title: Open Source Bridge Wrapup
Date: 2012-07-01

Friday marked the end of Open Source Bridge. Just about the best introduction
to Portland culture as you can find. Vegan lunches, Voodoo Donut catering, 
lunch truck friday, and rock and roll pipe organists in the Unitarian's 
sanctuary. 

[The][1] [keynotes][2] [were][3] pretty cool. I'd seen Fenwick's presentation
from LCA, and was surprised at how much had changed, hopefully since some of
his keystone evidence turned out to be bogus; turns out there's strong 
evidence that the only "priming" effect was in grad students running the study.
I'm still not quite clear on what JScott wants people to run vbox for, but he
did have a really good idea about bringing your own recording equipment that I
wish I had taken to heart.

Probably the most useful talk I attended was Laura Thompson's presentation on
[Mozilla's Crash Reporting service][5], powered by [Socorro][4]. A few of the
projects the OSL hosts are desktop apps and collecting crash data might be
a good engineering tool win for them. A lot of embedded hardware talks that
would have been interesting, but not directly relevant to the needs of the 
OSL. Hopefully they'll be up as recordings soon. 

The OSL was also well represented as well in the speaker's ranks: we ran five 
sessions during the main conference, and two during the Friday unconference.
I think next year it would be a good idea to encourage our students to
participate as volunteers; getting them facetime with speakers and the
community at large can only do us a world of good. I gave a first run of a
talk on using GNUCash for personal finance; the turnout was pretty good,
given how many people were still at the food carts. I should have recorded 
it to self-critique and improve.

The "after party" on Thursday was nice. Lance won the [2012 Outsanding Open 
Source Citizen award][6], which is great, because he deserves recongition for 
handling the turmoil at the OSL over the past year. But now I've got to 
figure out my plan meet or beat that for next year. No small task.

Next up is catching up back at the Lab, and then OSCON!
