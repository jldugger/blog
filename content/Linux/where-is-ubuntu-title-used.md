Title: Where is Ubuntu Title used?
Date: 2008-07-17

[The following][1] up on the ArtTeam mailing list today:

> I always assumed it (the font) to be a convenience in order to display the
brand consistently. I've never really thought of using it for anything other
than "ubuntu". Are there any examples where it is used for other purposes?

I came up with a few answers, but I'm sure there's more out there. So I'm
asking my readers: **Where have you spotted the Ubuntu titling font?**

I think as an experiment in font usability, I'll switch all the system fonts
on my machine :-)
