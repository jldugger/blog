Title: I owe someone a thank you
Date: 2008-10-17

Sometime during the last few weeks my Intel HDA based [Toshiba Tecra M7][1]
tablet finally supported headphone jack-sense. No longer will I feel like an
amateur plugging in headphones and fumbling about figuring out how to silence
the speakers but not the headphones. Yay!
