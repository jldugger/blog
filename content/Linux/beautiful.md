Title: Beautiful
Date: 2008-09-17

I won't ruin the RSS with a huge image, but here's a [graphical flow][1] of
iptables/netfilter. Netfilter is an awesomely complex beast, as the image
shows.

Unfortunately, the author has some [scathing][2] [reviews][3] of Ubuntu 8.04,
concluding:

> An absolute fail distro. Really, I recommend Windows XP anytime over Ubuntu.
(But of course, SUSE/Fedora in the pole position still.)

I appreciate Jan's contribution and dedication to kernel.org and elsewhere; I
will leave it to others to debunk or affirm his individual complaints. But
framing the complaints of a kernel hacker as applicable to Windows users is
disingenuous.
