Title: Ubuntu is for ricers?
Date: 2009-04-21

nixternal [takes funroll-loops a little too literally][1], and discovers that
there's more Ubuntu stickers than Gentoo.

Obviously, stickers are a passive tool to communicate. Conversation starters,
if you will. And certainly people can tie up identity with a popular brand. I
recall seeing a poor grad student who didn't have a MacBook with an Apple logo
glued over their Acer logo (poor Acer). She quickly scurried away as the next
lab got started, so I didn't get a chance to ask the story behind it. I have a
hard time putting myself in the shoes of a Gentoo user and wanting to explain
Gentoo to someone who isn't using it. It would just serve to highlight the
gulf between nerds and normal people. So I can imagine why there aren't many
Gentoo stickers in the wild.

nixternal also asks for laptop stickers, and I just happened to finish
photographing some I received in the mail today. Martin Owens [chronicles how
ZaReason came to offer them][2]. Here's an amateur photo with a yellow lamp
bulb and white flash:
