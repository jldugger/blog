Title: I love the internet
Date: 2008-01-11

They say that open source didn't really take off until the internet was
popular, and open source probably milks it for all it's worth. But sometimes
the Internet isn't enough, and several [conferences][1] have grown from it.
Ubuntu their Developer Summits, O'Reilly hosts OSCON, and some enterprising
guys in Austrailia host Linuxconf.

[Linuxconf 2008][2] is coming up shortly, and one of the reasons I like
it is that unlike the other conferences, it takes the Internet to heart.
Nearly all lectures are recorded and made available for poor / lazy folk like
me to view at my leisure. It's a great way to kill a day or two. Several look
promising:

* Dave Jones will be giving a lecture on what he does I guess

* Matt Garrett will be giving a talk on suspend to disk. I wish he'd give a
lecture on open source bioinformatics tools available some time<br>* Dave
Arlie has a talk scheduled about open source 3d drivers

* A pair of debianites are going to talk about why big companies don't like
Debian<br>* A talk on setting up an apt repo

* A security lecture on Debian Security<br>* open source animation tools demo
by Bdale Garbee's daughter Elizabeth

* MPX - multi pointer X. for those with tablets<br>

There's tons more. If you live in town, I envy you.<p>
