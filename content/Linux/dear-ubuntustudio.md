Title: Dear UbuntuStudio
Date: 2008-07-03

I know there's tons of applications of the [last post][1], but I thought there
wasn't much in the way of GPL'd implementations. Today, I saw this awesome
screenshot, [from][2] the audio-visual program [CLAM][3]:

The above comes from their Qt based [Network Editor][5] application. This
is hardly unique among audio applications -- I recall seeing graphEdit years
ago on Windows. But I think perhaps there's some great underlying
functionality ready to break out for wider uses. [Ohloh][6] suggests that it's
a mature application with lots of developers, but few comments. CLAM is one of
Google's 2008 SoC projects, and some interesting new functionality is on the
way thanks to that. One project in particular sounds as useful outside the
audio domain: [Network Scalability][7], by Natanael Olaiz (mentor, Pau Arum√≠).
Basically, writing the infrastructure to allow sub-networks, and sub-sub-
networks etc. [ He appears to be making good progress,][8] and I hope he
succeeds!

(This is why I always say everything you've ever thought of has already
been done on the Internet.)
