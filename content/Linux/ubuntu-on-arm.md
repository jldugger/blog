Title: Ubuntu on ARM
Date: 2008-11-13

Canonical has [just announced][1] that they'll be bringing the ARM arch to
Ubuntu. This is quite exciting -- ARM devices have been getting more and more
features, and as LinuxDevices [reports][2], there's been unofficial builds by
Nokia for a while. Centralizing the builds should help reduce the effort
needed to set up Ubuntu on such platforms. For example, currently builds
happen after release and are announced when they're complete; we can now
expect regular builds throughout development and a release date people can
plan around.

There's some interesting hardware coming my way that I'd like to try this on,
but I won't share just what it is until I actually have one in my hands, since
they've sold out their first small batch and having problems in manufacturing.

In the meantime, I'll be hanging out in #ubuntu-arm observing.
