One last post on [the subject][1] of [money][2].

I know that the dollar's been on a recent downward trend, but [this still
feels exorbitant][3]. But the old "strong dollar in name only" policy cuts
both ways -- maybe it's time to set up a shop in the land of cheaper exports?
Shipping itself adds nearly 50% to the price!

UPDATE: fixed the shop link!
